- Hunting for roots in finite field polynomials with Chien search
- Look up BCH(15,7) example from in class
	- suppose r, determine most likely codeword
		- calculate syndromes over GF(16)
		    r(x) = x^3 + ... + x^12
		   s_1 = r(alpha) = ... = alpha^10
		- look up cooper article
		- determine the error locator polynomial	
			- alhpha^5  = 1/a^10
			- stop at lambda 2 bc 15,7 2 error correcting code 	
		- find the roots of lmbda(x) by checking them exhaustively
		
- like hw7, but with a different r
